# fasttext_basic

Dataset

text8 corpus

How to run

python fasttext.py [partition]

partition : "part" if you want to train on a part of corpus (faster training but worse performance), "full" if you want to train on full corpus (better performance but slower training)

Examples) python fasttext.py part // fasttext algorithm trained by part of text8 corpus

You should adjust the other hyperparameters in the code file manually.
